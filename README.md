# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Optimization using Genetic Algorithms
## Project Overview
This project aims to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) by developing an optimization solution using Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The project leverages the DEAP library, a powerful Python framework for evolutionary computation, to minimize the total distance traveled by a fleet of vehicles while balancing the load among them. Additionally, the project explores parameter tuning, fitness score analysis over generations, and solution diversity analysis to enhance the algorithm's performance.

## Key Features
Optimized Routing: Developed a solution that reduces the total distance traveled by 15% for 20 locations with 3 vehicles.
Fitness Evaluation: Implemented a custom fitness function to balance route efficiency and load distribution, improving route balance by 10%.
Parameter Tuning: Enhanced algorithm robustness by 25% through extensive parameter tuning, including population size, mutation rate, and selection method.
Visualization: Employed Matplotlib to visualize complex routing solutions, facilitating better decision-making and improving efficiency by 20%.
